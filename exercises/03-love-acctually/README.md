# Interstellar Mining Operations

A simulation of remote controlled starships mining for ore in deep space. The ore profits are instantaneously teleported in case of success. Scanners have a limited range; if the starship or the mineral ore go out of range the simulation will stop. Fast floating rocks will destroy your spaceship. You can always launch another one.
