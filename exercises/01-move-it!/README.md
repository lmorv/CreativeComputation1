# I Like to Move It, 3D cubes edition

Blue cube grows according to the mouse position along the X axis, red cube grows along the Y axis. A 3rd user-controlled cube follows the mouse along the XY plane, acquiring the hue of the colored cube being scaled, which can be a combination of red & blue at non-axial coordinates of the XY plane.
Cubes reach their maximum size at either (positive & negative) extremes of their control axis, and hit a minimum size at the 'world origin' (0,0,0).
The whole thing rotates diagonally to baffle the mind.
