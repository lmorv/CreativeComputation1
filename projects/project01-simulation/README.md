# CUBE!

This program simulates the real-life mechanics of a 2x2x2 Rubik's Cube using a color update approach on pre-defined faces with fixed dimensions and positions in 3D space. Faces form `cubies`, which are then grouped into `layers` that are dynamically displayed and animated alongside simulated rotation behavior based on user input.
