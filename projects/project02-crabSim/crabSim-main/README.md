# CRAB SIMULATOR - Main Branch

Crab simulator is the ultimate rampaging crab experience. This program seeks to digitally represent the complete obliteration of civilization via giant coconut crab attack; allowing users to step fully into the rampaging crab fantasy through a collection of interlocking interactive program states featuring narrative-immersive human language and The Illusion of Choice [1]. Avenge the ecological crimes inflicted upon marine life and Arthropods in particular by repeatedly turning urbanized centers of human population into mush!

Gamified for human consumption, Crab simulator offers an incentive system composed of two main factors: A dynamically generated city scape that serves as the object of destruction. And the progressive spawning of corrupted quantum bits of information that threaten the simulation from within. As a crab it is up to you to preserve the simulation by consuming the corrupted q-bits, and forge ahead, obliterating one city after another in ever-increasing scale (which grows proportional to your glory).

While the Crab Construct's representational prowess and aesthetic manifestation are limited, there exist hope that through the data gathered from this, and future (more sophisticated) iterations of Crab Simulator the fact of Arthropod dominion will become, simply, inevitable. And so evolution is enhanced by digital technology; to strive for excellence, to journey proudly through uncertainty, to face complexity before non-existence. For this is only the beginning.
