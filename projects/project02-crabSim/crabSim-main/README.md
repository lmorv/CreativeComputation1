# CRAB SIMULATOR - Main Branch

[mostly broken at the moment]

This prototype sketch features a primitive crab construct, made out of cubes, imbued with the ability of polar movement using the ASWD or arrow keys, and a grid of rectangles placed in 3d space which will serve to position the game objects in the complete simulation.

The structural groundwork has also been laid out in the form of conditional state change expressions in the main script and more game object classes that I'll ever need for the fully fledged simulation. The bulk of the tangible work remains in the main script and the Crab class on this iteration.

Consult the Crab Simulator Proposal PDF document for more info.
